Café Culture in Paris
Parisian cafés are more than coffee stops—they’re social institutions. Nestled at street corners and boulevards, 
establishments like Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots have historically hosted philosophers like Sartre and artists like Picasso. 
The typical Parisian café serves as an extension of one's living room: a place to read, write, debate politics, or simply people-watch. 
The terrace seating and slow service aren't accidental; they’re by design, encouraging lingering. Espresso dominates, 
but it's the ritual of sitting and savoring that defines Paris’s café identity.
