Café Culture in Helsinki
In Helsinki, café culture reflects the Finnish love for coffee—one of the highest per capita consumption rates in the world. 
Cafés are cozy, often minimalist spaces that emphasize sustainability and local flavors. 
It’s common to find reindeer sandwiches next to oat milk lattes, and people enjoy their time slowly, 
often surrounded by Nordic design and peaceful vibes.
