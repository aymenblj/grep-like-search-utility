Tech Industry in New York
Silicon Alley, centered in Manhattan and expanding into Brooklyn, has made NYC a powerhouse in media tech, fintech, and health tech. 
Giants like Google and Meta have major offices here, but it’s the startup scene—with its diversity and access to capital—that fuels 
the city's tech ecosystem. NYC also excels in applying tech to legacy industries like finance and media.
