Architecture in Paris
Paris's architecture is a blend of medieval, Renaissance, and modern influences. Iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower 
and Notre-Dame contrast with Haussmannian boulevards and contemporary marvels like La DÃ©fense's skyscrapers. 
The strict building codes help maintain its historic charm, ensuring harmony between old and new. 
The city is essentially a living museum of architectural evolution.
